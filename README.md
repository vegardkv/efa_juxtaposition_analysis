- Single to multiple horizon input
- Supports horizon shifting
- Generates interactive throw profiles and juxtaposition diagrams
- Session save/load capabilities
- Figure to clip-borad support and saves figure to different formats
- CSV export functionality

## Installation

### Quick Setup (Recommended)

**Option 1: Download Pre-built Application**
Download the latest pre-built version from [Releases](https://github.com/equinor/efa_juxtaposition_analysis/releases) and run it directly - no installation required.

**Option 2: Clone Repository + Install with uv**

If you prefer to install dependencies directly with uv after cloning:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/equinor/efa_juxtaposition_analysis.git
cd efa_juxtaposition_analysis

# Install dependencies
uv sync

# Optional: include Windows-specific dependencies
uv sync --extra windows

# Run the application
uv run python efa_juxtaposition_app/EFA_juxtaposition_app.py
```

**Option 3: Direct Installation (No Git Required)**

Download and run the installer script:
```bash
# Download the installer
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/equinor/efa_juxtaposition_analysis/main/install_efa.py -o install_efa.py

# Run the installer
python install_efa.py
```

**Option 4: Install as uv Tool**
```bash
uv tool install git+https://github.com/equinor/efa_juxtaposition_analysis.git
efa-juxtaposition  # Run the application
```

These scripts will:
- Check if `uv` is installed
- Install all required dependencies automatically
- Set up the virtual environment
- Install platform-specific dependencies (Windows clipboard support, etc.)


### Manual Installation

#### Using uv (Recommended)

This guide explains how to install python using uv, create an application folder and install dependencies for the application. If you already have installed python using uv, step 1 and 2 can be skipped.
More information abut installing python using uv can be found at the Equinor wiki. 

1. Open cmd and type or copy/paste:
   ```
   winget install --id=astral-sh.uv -e
   ```

   press 'Y' when asked. When it finishes, close the command-line interpreter window.

2. Open a new command-line interpreter window (cmd) and install the latest Python, type or copy/paste:
   ```
   uv python install
   ```

3. Navigate to c:/Appl and create application folder. If the Appl folder don't exist, create it. In command_line_interptreter (cmd), type or copy/paste:
   ```
      c:
      cd \Appl
      uv init efa_uv_app
   ```

4. Navigate into the application folder, in cmd type or copy/paste:
   ```
   cd efa_uv_app
   ```

5. Install application dependencies, in cmd type or copy/paste:
   ```
   uv add numpy pandas matplotlib scipy shapely pywin32
   ```

6. Download the application files from GitHub:
   - [EFA_juxtaposition_v0p9p6.py](./efa_juxtaposition_app/EFA_juxtaposition_app.py)
   - [EFA_juxtaposition_launcher.bat](./efa_juxtaposition_app/EFA_juxtaposition_launcher.bat)

   
   Copy these files into your application folder (c:\Appl\efa_uv_app\). 

## Launching the Application


### Option 1: Using Batch File (Recommended)
The application can be launched by double-clicking one of the provided batch files:
- **EFA_juxtaposition_launcher.bat** - Basic launcher with dependency checks


Both batch files will:
- Check if uv is installed
- Verify the application directory exists
- Confirm the Python file is present
- Validate that all required libraries are installed
- Launch the application if all checks pass

### Option 2: Using Command Line
Alternatively, the application can be launched using cmd. Navigate to the application directory and run:
```cmd
cd c:\Appl\efa_uv_app
uv run EFA_juxtaposition_app.py
```

### Creating a Desktop Shortcut
You can create a shortcut to either batch file and copy it to your desktop for easy access.

### Using the Repository Setup

If you've cloned this repository and have `pyproject.toml`, you can also run:

```cmd
# Install dependencies
uv sync

# Run the application
uv run python efa_juxtaposition_app/EFA_juxtaposition_app.py
```

Or install with Windows-specific dependencies:
```cmd
uv sync --extra windows
```

#### Installation using pip

1. Ensure Python 3.x is installed
2. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install matplotlib pandas numpy scipy shapely pywin32
   ```
3. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python EFA_juxtaposition_app.py
   ```

## Usage

Launch the application and use the tabbed interface to:
- Load geological data
- Create interactive plots
- Analyze juxtaposition relationships
- Export results
