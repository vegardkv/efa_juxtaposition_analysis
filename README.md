# EFA Juxtaposition Analysis

Geology application to quicky analyze fault juxtaposition for single faults by creating throw profiles and juxtaposition (Allan) diagrams.

## Features

- Input Petrel Fault cuttof points or Cegal fault cuttof points in Petrel points with attribute format
- Single to multiple horizon input
- Supports horizon shifting
- Generates interactive throw profiles and juxtaposition diagrams
- Session save/load capabilities
- Figure to clip-borad support and saves figure to different formats
- CSV export functionality

## Installation

If you don't already have python installed on your system, it is recommended to use uv for installing the application and dependencies. However, you can also use pip if this is preferred.

Installation using uv:
This guide explains how to install python using uv, create an application folder and install dependencies for the application. If you already have installed python using uv, step 1 and 2 can be skipped.
More information abut installing python using uv can be found at the Equinor wiki. 

1. Open cmd and type or copy/paste:
   ```
   winget install --id=astral-sh.uv -e
   ```

   press 'Y' when asked. When it finishes, close the command-line interpreter window.

2. Open a new command-line interpreter window (cmd) and install the latest Python, type or copy/paste:
   ```
   uv python install
   ```

3. Navigate to c:/Appl and create application folder. If the Appl folder don't exist, create it. In command_line_interptreter (cmd), type or copy/paste:
   ```
      c:
      cd \Appl
      uv init efa_uv_app
   ```

4. Navigate into the application folder, in cmd type or copy/paste:
   ```
   cd efa_uv_app
   ```

5. Install application dependencies, in cmd type or copy/paste:
   ```
   uv add numpy pandas matplotlib scipy shapely
   ```

6. Download the application files from GitHub:
   - [EFA_juxtaposition_v0p9p6.py](./efa_juxtaposition_app/EFA_juxtaposition_v0p9p6.py)
   - [EFA_juxtaposition_launcher.bat](./efa_juxtaposition_app/EFA_juxtaposition_launcher.bat)
   
   Copy these files into your application folder (c:\Appl\efa_uv_app\). 
The application can now be launched by double clicking EFA_juxtaposition_launcher.bat

Alternatively the application can be launched using cmd, type or copy/paste:
```
cd c:\Appl\efa_uv_app\ && uv run EFA_juxtaposition_v0p9p6.py
```

The application can also be launcehd by downloading or creating the batch file EFA_juxtaposition_launcher.bat. A shortcut to the .bat file can also be made, and copied to e.g. your desktop.


Installation using pip

1. Ensure Python 3.x is installed
2. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install tkinter matplotlib pandas numpy scipy shapely pillow
   ```
3. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python EFA_juxtaposition_v0p93_u2.py
   ```

## Usage

Launch the application and use the tabbed interface to:
- Load geological data
- Create interactive plots
- Analyze juxtaposition relationships
- Export results
